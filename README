pcimax-ctl
---------

installation:
this program requires the libudev library (for auto device detection)
Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libudev0 libudev-dev

default installation path is /usr/local/bin
installation path can be changed by setting PREFIX variable
(sudo make PREFIX=/opt install)

cd ~
git clone http://github.com/koradlow/pcimax-ctl && cd pcimax-ctl
make
sudo make install
#sudo make uninstall

development status:
this program is still under development, but it offers the same feature
set as the official windows program with the exception of dynamic 
Program Station names (see limitations).
If you find a bug or run into other problems please report to
https://github.com/koradlow/pcimax-ctl/issues

licence: 
all code is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)

latest version:
you can always find the latest version of this tool in the git repo:
https://github.com/koradlow/pcimax-ctl

limitations:
- the card only supports European country codes (ecc) {E0..E4}
- the dynamic PS feature of the card is not supported because the RDS standard
  explicitly states that the station name shouldn't be used dynamically

usage:
pcimax-ctl --help
will display a summary and explanation of the available options

pcimax-ctl --file=/home/user/pcimax_ctl/config.ini
most users will probaly want to use a configuration file for setting the
options. An example for a config file can be found in the sourcecode folder
that was created during installation. 

pcimax-ctl --file=/home/user/pcimax_ctl/config.ini --monitor
it can be very handy to keep the program running in the background and have
it updating the settings whenever the config file is modfied.
